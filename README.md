# Creating Data Products Final Project

## This repo contains the files I made as part of my Developing Data Products Project.

## Objective: Write a simple shiny app and html5 slideshow using R markdown via the shiny and slidify packages (respectively)

## I chose to write a Shiny app to convert temperatures in degrees Fahrenheit or Celsius to the other unit
* The ui.R and server.R files are included in this repo.
* The app can be found at https://jstratton.shinyapps.io/Temperature_Converter/

## I also wrote a slideshow pitching this app using slidify
* The files used to make the presentation can be found in the app_pitch folder
* I created a gh-pages branch so that my presentation can be viewed directly at http://jstratton.github.io/creating_data_products_final_project/app_pitch/index.html
